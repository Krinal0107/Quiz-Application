This repository contains Quiz challenge built with React (Vite), Redux Toolkit, Framer Motion, and TailwindCSS, deployed on Vercel.

## About The Project

Frontend Quiz App is a single-page application (SPA) built with React using the Vite build tool, aimed at providing a faster and more efficient development experience for modern web projects. For state management, it utilizes React Redux and React Redux Toolkit (RTK), enhancing productivity and maintainability.

Styling is accomplished with Tailwind CSS, where I've customized a theme with unique colors, font sizes, typography, backgrounds, box shadows, and more. Tailwind CSS offers exceptional flexibility and ease of use, allowing for streamlined development and consistent design across the application.

Initially, I structured the project with React Router, creating separate routes for different pages such as Home, Quiz Question, and Quiz Result. However, after implementing Redux, this approach became unnecessary, leading to a more organized and cohesive codebase.

Additionally, I incorporated animations using Framer Motion, enhancing the user experience with fluid transitions and interactive elements. Framer Motion provides powerful tools for creating captivating motion effects, such as page transitions, element animations, and gestures, further elevating the visual appeal and interactivity of the application.
